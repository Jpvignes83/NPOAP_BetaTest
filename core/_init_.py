"""Core package for the photometric analysis tool.

This package exposes the main classes and functions used throughout the
application:

- ``ImageProcessor`` for CCD reduction and calibration
- ``CalculateMaster`` to build master calibration frames
- ``process_alignment`` and ``parallel_process_images`` for image alignment
- ``PerformPlateSolving`` for astrometric solving
- ``JD_BJD_Calculator`` for astronomical time calculations
- ``process_photometry`` for basic photometric analysis
- ``validate_fits_header`` to check FITS header coordinates
